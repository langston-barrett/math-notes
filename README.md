# Math notes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siddharthist/math-notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siddharthist/math-notes)

These are notes from classes and textbooks, primarily for backup purposes. While
anyone is welcome to read and view these, please do not distribute them or
attribute their content to me.

They are automatically compiled with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/)
and are available for download:

 * [Group theory](https://siddharthist.github.io/math-notes/group-theory.pdf)
 * [Cryptography](https://siddharthist.github.io/math-notes/crypto.pdf)

Eventually, I'd like to automatically create and upload Anki flashcards with my
program [amsthm-to-anki](https://github.com/siddharthist/amsthm-to-anki/).

Sources for information should be noted in the body of the `.tex` file, near the
beginning.
