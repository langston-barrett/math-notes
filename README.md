# Math notes

These are notes from classes and textbooks that I have actually proofread, and so feel comfortable putting online.

The goal is to automatically compile them with Travis and upload PDF versions to
a Github branch, as well as automatically create Anki flashcards with my
program [amsthm-to-anki](https://github.com/siddharthist/amsthm-to-anki/).

Sources for information should be noted in the body of the `.tex` file, near the
beginning.
